        üí• IT field is a huge passion for me, especially the areas of web
        development and UX/UI design, which I have been involved in for some
        time in the form of self-education‚Ä¶ and where I have finally managed to
        get through on a work level, specifically as a Junior Frontend Developer
        at OKsystem, which supplies software to private companies and public
        administrations.

        üí• In the spring of 2022, I graduated from the Digital Academy: Web,
        i.e. an almost 4-month intensive frontend web development course via
        Czechitas. According to Academy, I have learned not only to work with
        various technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Git, Webpack, etc.),
        but also to work in a team and under the guidance of a mentor. This
        collaboration resulted in a project called Peak to Geek ü¶• I have also
        completed an Introduction to UX course and subsequently a long-term UX
        course, also via Czechitas, and a part of the UX course via Google on
        the Coursera platform.

      <h3 className="text-tertiary">IT Education, R&D</h3>
      <p>
        üí• In addition to FE development, I work in the Czechitas R&D team with
        a focus on IT education, where I help with market analysis, preparation
        and output quality of teaching and organizational materials. During
        this, I am constantly learning how the technical background of
        educational events works, I meet a lot of inspiring and interesting
        people from the IT world, from whom I can learn a lot of things and then
        apply them in practice - both in education itself and in IT and their
        combination. #czechitas #chciseucIT #goforIT Website ‚û°Ô∏è
