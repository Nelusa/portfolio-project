            üí• IT field is a huge passion for me, especially the areas of web
            development and UX/UI design, which I have been involved in for some
            time in the form of self-education‚Ä¶ and where I have finally managed
            to get through on a work level, specifically as a Junior Frontend
            Developer at OKsystem, which supplies software to private companies
            and public administrations.

                üí• In the spring of 2022, I graduated from the Digital Academy:
                Web, i.e. an almost 4-month intensive frontend web development
                course via Czechitas. According to Academy, I have learned not
                only to work with various technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                React, Git, Webpack, etc.), but also to work in a team and under
                the guidance of a mentor. This collaboration resulted in a
                project called Peak to Geek ü¶•

              <p className="mt-8">
                üí• I have also completed an Introduction to UX course and
                subsequently a long-term UX course, also via Czechitas, and a
                part of the UX course via Google on the Coursera platform.

            üí• In addition to FE development, I work in the Czechitas R&D team
            with a focus on IT education, where I help with market analysis,
            preparation and output quality of teaching and organizational
            materials. During this, I am constantly learning how the technical
            background of educational events works, I meet a lot of inspiring
            and interesting people from the IT world, from whom I can learn a
            lot of things and then apply them in practice - both in education
            itself and in IT and their combination. #czechitas #chciseucIT
