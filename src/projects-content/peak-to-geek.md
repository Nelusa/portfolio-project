excerpt: Peak to Geek is a motivational IT platform focused on knowledge and career development in the field of UX and UI design.
description: The foundation of the platform is a unique user profile with a dashboard that tracks the user's progress across the UX/UI field. In addition to the dashboard, the platform has two main components - a UX/UI roadmap with gamification elements and a personal database of online courses with recommended courses from the Geek community.
description2: The project was created as part of the Digital Academy Web by Czechitas. I collaborated on it with my partner, Eva Machov√°. We were responsible for the UX/UI design and the frontend development of the platform.

plan: Miro was our basis, where we laid out what content the platform could have and how many separate pages it would actually fit. At the beginning, of course, our plans were big, so the platform was supposed to have up to a dozen pages and components, but as time went by, we reduced and reduced and reduced... Currently, Mir is primarily an overview of the content that will be on the page.
